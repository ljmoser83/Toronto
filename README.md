# Cultural Hotspots Along Bike Trails in Toronto
This map was created for Assignment 1 in MAP 675 at the University of Kentucky by Lee Moser and Chris Pappas. We chose to focus on Toronto, Canada, because they are a bike-friendly city, have a great variety of cultural spots to explore, and have excellent open data. We downloaded our data from [Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal](https://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=9e56e03bb8d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD). Our data sets included:

  *[Cultural Hotspots](https://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=c63e6b6911b31510VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&vgnextchannel=1a66e03bb8d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD)  
  *[Bike Trails](https://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=9ecd5f9cd70bb210VgnVCM1000003dd60f89RCRD&vgnextchannel=1a66e03bb8d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD)  
  *[Heritage districts](https://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=6c53137135b85410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&vgnextchannel=1a66e03bb8d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD)  
  *[Boundary for City of Toronto](https://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=c1a6e72ced779310VgnVCM1000003dd60f89RCRD&vgnextchannel=1a66e03bb8d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD)  

The scenario that we envisioned is that the City of Toronto wants to highlight the many cultural hotspots along their various bike trails. They also wanted to see which heritage districts the bike trails passed through. Mouse-hovers over the various locations trigger a popup with the name of the location, a brief description, and website, if provided.
